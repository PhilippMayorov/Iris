# ‚úÖ FIXED: Slack OAuth HTTPS Setup Complete

## Problem Resolution Summary

### ‚ùå Previous Issues:

1. **ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED**: Using HTTP when Slack requires HTTPS
2. **ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR**: No proper SSL certificate for HTTPS localhost

### ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. **HTTPS Requirement Compliance**

- Updated redirect URI to: `https://localhost:8080/callback`
- Slack **mandates HTTPS** for all OAuth redirect URIs (including localhost)

#### 2. **Self-Signed SSL Certificate Creation**

- Automatically generates `localhost.crt` and `localhost.key`
- Certificate valid for 1 year
- Includes proper Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for localhost

#### 3. **HTTPS Server Implementation**

- Custom `HTTPSServer` class extending Python's `HTTPServer`
- Proper SSL context configuration
- Secure callback handling following Slack's OAuth 2.0 spec

#### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- Clear browser security warning guidance
- Comprehensive troubleshooting information
- Automatic cleanup on failures

## Current Status: ‚úÖ READY

### Tests Completed:

- ‚úÖ SSL certificate creation: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS server startup: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ OAuth URL generation: **WORKING**
- ‚úÖ Configuration validation: **WORKING**

## Next Steps for You:

### 1. Update Slack App Configuration

```
1. Go to: https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Select your Slack app
3. Navigate to: OAuth & Permissions
4. Under Redirect URLs, ensure you have:
   ‚Üí https://localhost:8080/callback
5. Click Save URLs
```

### 2. Required Bot Token Scopes

Make sure these scopes are configured in your Slack app:

- `chat:write` - Send messages to channels and DMs
- `im:write` - Send direct messages
- `im:read` - Read direct messages
- `channels:read` - View basic info about public channels
- `im:history` - View messages in direct messages
- `users:read` - View people in workspace

### 3. Run the Setup

```bash
cd src/agents/new-agents/slack_agent
python setup_slack_agent.py
```

Choose option 1 (Complete OAuth flow now) and follow these steps:

1. **SSL Certificate**: Script automatically creates certificate
2. **HTTPS Server**: Starts on `https://localhost:8080`
3. **Browser Opens**: Slack authorization page loads
4. **Security Warning**: Browser shows warning - **this is normal**
   - Chrome/Edge: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
   - Firefox: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Accept the Risk and Continue"
   - Safari: Click "Show Details" ‚Üí "Visit Website"
5. **Authorize App**: Complete Slack authorization
6. **Token Exchange**: Automatic secure token storage
7. **Complete**: Ready to use Slack agent!

## What to Expect:

### ‚úÖ Success Flow:

```
üí¨ Slack Agent OAuth 2.0 Setup
üîê Creating self-signed SSL certificate for localhost...
‚úÖ SSL certificate created: localhost.crt
‚úÖ HTTPS callback server running at https://localhost:8080
üåê Opening authorization URL in browser...
üì® Callback received: /callback?code=...
‚úÖ Authorization code received: 1234567890...
üîë Exchanging authorization code for access tokens...
‚úÖ Token exchange successful!
üíæ Saving tokens securely...
‚úÖ Tokens saved securely to slack_tokens.enc
üéâ SLACK OAUTH SETUP COMPLETE!
```

### Files Created:

- `localhost.crt` - SSL certificate (auto-generated)
- `localhost.key` - Private key (auto-generated)
- `slack_tokens.enc` - Encrypted tokens (after successful auth)

## Security Notes:

- ‚úÖ Self-signed certificates are **safe for localhost development**
- ‚úÖ Private keys never leave your local machine
- ‚úÖ Tokens are encrypted before storage using Fernet encryption
- ‚úÖ This follows standard practices for local HTTPS development

## Troubleshooting:

### Browser Security Warning

- **Expected behavior** for self-signed certificates
- **Safe to proceed** - it's your own local server
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost"

### Still Getting SSL Errors?

```bash
# Delete old certificates and retry
rm localhost.crt localhost.key
python setup_slack_agent.py
```

## You're All Set! üéâ

The Slack OAuth setup now properly implements HTTPS as required by Slack's API. The setup script will:

1. Create a valid SSL certificate automatically
2. Start a secure HTTPS server
3. Handle the complete OAuth 2.0 flow
4. Save tokens securely for your agent

**Ready to proceed with setup when you are!**
