## Running the Agent

1. Start the agent:
```bash
cd /Users/benpetlach/Desktop/dev/hackathons/hd4/Iris/src/agents/new-agents/spotifyAgent
python spotify_agent.py
```

2. The agent will start on port 8005 and display the endpoints:
```
üéµ Starting Spotify Playlist Agent...
Your agent's address is: agent1q...
Spotify Integration: üü¢ REAL Spotify API
Starting agent server...
```

3. Test the endpoints using the cURL commands above.

## Integration Examples

### Python Client
```python
import requests

# Send a natural language request
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8005/chat",
    json={"text": "Create a pop playlist with 10 songs"}
)

result = response.json()
print(result["message"])
```

### JavaScript/Node.js Client
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8005/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: 'Create a workout playlist with 15 songs'
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result.message);
```

## Notes

- All playlist operations use the real Spotify API (when authenticated)
- Responses include Spotify URLs for direct access to created playlists
- The agent supports both specific and general music requests
- Error messages are user-friendly and provide guidance
