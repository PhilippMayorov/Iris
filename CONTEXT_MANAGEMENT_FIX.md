# Context Management Fix for uAgent Communication

## Problem Identified

The context management between the mailbox agent and Gmail agent was broken, causing several issues:

1. **Separate Conversation Contexts**: Each agent maintained its own conversation history with different keys
2. **Context Loss**: When the mailbox agent routed to the Gmail agent, the Gmail agent didn't have access to the full conversation context
3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The mailbox agent showed it couldn't send emails, but the Gmail agent showed successful sends
4. **Missing Context Sharing**: Conversation history wasn't being passed properly between agents

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the conversation data files:

### Mailbox Agent (`agent1qgey99jvwx_data.json`)
- Had conversation with user about sending emails
- User asked "did it send?" but agent lost context
- Agent responded with "I'm not sure which email you're referring to"

### Gmail Agent (`agent1qw6kgumlfq_data.json`) 
- Had separate conversation context
- Successfully processed and sent emails
- But couldn't access the mailbox agent's conversation context

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Communication Models

**Updated `AgentEmailRequest` to include conversation history:**
```python
class AgentEmailRequest(Model):
    to: str
    subject: str
    body: str
    from_email: Optional[str] = None
    original_message: str  # The original user message for context
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None  # Full conversation context
```

### 2. Context Passing in Mailbox Agent

**Updated the email routing logic to pass conversation history:**
```python
email_request = AgentEmailRequest(
    to=email_info.get("to", "") if email_info else "",
    subject=email_info.get("subject", "") if email_info else "",
    body=email_info.get("body", "") if email_info else "",
    original_message=text,  # Send the original user message
    conversation_history=conversation_history  # Pass the full conversation context
)
```

### 3. Context Reception in Gmail Agent

**Updated the Gmail agent to use shared conversation history:**
```python
# Use conversation history from the mailbox agent if provided, otherwise get from storage
if msg.conversation_history:
    conversation_history = msg.conversation_history
    ctx.logger.info(f"ðŸ“§ Using conversation history from mailbox agent: {len(conversation_history)} messages")
else:
    # Fallback to local storage
    conversation_key = f"conversation_{sender}"
    conversation_history = ctx.storage.get(conversation_key) or []
```

### 4. Proper Conversation History Management

**Fixed conversation history storage to avoid duplication:**
```python
# Update conversation history (only for non-email routing cases)
if not (result["agent_routing"] and result["agent_routing"]["matched_agent"] == "email"):
    conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": text})
    conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response_text})
    # Store updated conversation history
```

## Testing Results

Created and ran a comprehensive test that verified:

### âœ… Test 1: Context-Aware Follow-up Question
- **Scenario**: User asks "did it send?" with full conversation history
- **Result**: Gmail agent correctly identified previous email context
- **Logs**: 
  ```
  ðŸ“§ Received conversation history: 5 messages
  ðŸ“§ History 1: user: say hello and that I miss them...
  ðŸ“§ History 2: assistant: Email ready to send. Should I send it?...
  ðŸ“§ History 3: user: yes send it...
  ðŸ“§ Context-aware response: Found previous email context
  ```

### âœ… Test 2: No Context Provided
- **Scenario**: User asks "did it send?" without conversation history
- **Result**: Gmail agent correctly requested clarification
- **Logs**:
  ```
  ðŸ“§ No conversation history provided
  ðŸ“§ Context-aware response: Insufficient conversation history
  ```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. **Unified Conversation Context**
- Both agents now share the same conversation history
- Context is preserved across agent boundaries
- No more "I don't know which email you're referring to" responses

### 2. **Improved User Experience**
- Users can ask follow-up questions like "did it send?" and get proper responses
- Conversation flows naturally between agents
- Context-aware responses based on full conversation history

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Gmail agent can provide more specific error messages based on conversation context
- Clarification requests are more intelligent and contextual
- Fallback mechanisms when context is missing

### 4. **Consistent Behavior**
- Both agents now have access to the same conversation state
- No more conflicting responses between agents
- Unified conversation management

## Implementation Details

### Conversation History Structure
```python
conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "please send an email to test@example.com"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I need more information. What would you like to say?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "say hello and that I miss them"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Email ready to send. Should I send it?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "yes send it"}
]
```

### Context-Aware Processing
The Gmail agent now uses the conversation history to:
- Understand follow-up questions like "did it send?"
- Provide context-aware responses
- Maintain conversation continuity
- Handle ambiguous requests intelligently

### Fallback Mechanisms
- If conversation history is not provided, falls back to local storage
- If local storage is empty, requests clarification
- Graceful degradation when context is missing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Agent Context Persistence**: Store conversation context in a shared location
2. **Context Compression**: Implement context summarization for long conversations
3. **Context Validation**: Add validation to ensure context integrity
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache frequently accessed conversation contexts
5. **Context Analytics**: Track context usage patterns for optimization

## Conclusion

The context management fix successfully resolves the conversation continuity issues between the mailbox agent and Gmail agent. Users can now have natural, context-aware conversations that span multiple agents without losing context or receiving confusing responses.

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding robust context sharing capabilities that significantly improve the user experience.
